# RESCUEBOTS
cooperative mobile robots with image processing (vuforia), using Android + Linux + Arduino


ABSTRACT

This monograph presents a project of cooperation between mobile robots with computer vision. The project consists of mobile robots equipped with smartphone with GPS, magnetometer, camera, Android OS 4.4.3; microcontroller; power circuit for motors and DC motors. The project also includes a communication server using PostgreSQL database and server socket. The system features two types of robots, explorers and specialists. Explorers are responsible for travel points of pre-defined geographical coordinates with longitude and latitude. While driving along these robots points looking for a pre-defined object by a photo. If the object is found, the robot moves towards the object. When the object is found, a flag is sent and an expert robot goes directly to object to capture it. For the project Android and Linux operating systems were used; JAVA programming language, HTML5, CSS, C ++, Servlet and JQuery; Socket for communication between server and client. This research has great relevance when we need to send robots to inhospitable and unknown places. Robots can connect to the server by the local wi-fi network or any other internet connection, including 3G, which facilitates the control and data collection. The robots can be used to rescue people in natural disasters such as earthquakes; minefield; in places with high levels of radiation, where humans can not go.

Keywords: Robotics cooperation, mobile robots, image processing.
